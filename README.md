# directionsscraping
I have scraped directions from google maps instead of api to fetch directions and provide back response to the node.js application


#Overview


The Chatbot Directions application is a web-based chatbot that provides directions between two locations. It allows users to enter a starting location and a destination, and the chatbot retrieves the directions and displays them to the user.

#Technologies Used



The application is built using the following technologies:

1. **Frontend:**
   - HTML: Used for creating the structure and layout of the web page.
   - CSS: Used for styling the web page and adding visual enhancements.
   - JavaScript: Used for handling user interactions and making asynchronous requests to the server.

2. **Backend:**
   - Node.js: A JavaScript runtime environment used for server-side development.
   - Express.js: A web application framework for Node.js, used for handling HTTP requests and routing.
   - Python: A programming language used for implementing the backend logic and interacting with external services.
   - Flask: A lightweight web framework for Python, used for creating a RESTful API endpoint.
   - Selenium: A web testing framework used for automating browser actions and interacting with web elements.
   
3. **Mapping and Routing Service:**
   - Selenium Webdriver Scripting: A mapping and routing service provided by automating scripts Google Maps, used for retrieving directions between two locations.

#Functionality
The Chatbot Directions application provides the following functionality:

1. **User Interface:**
   - The web application provides a user-friendly interface where users can input their starting location and destination.
   - The interface is designed using HTML and CSS to provide an intuitive and visually appealing experience.
   - JavaScript is used to handle user interactions, such as form submission and making AJAX requests to the server.

2. **Backend Logic:**
   - The backend is built using Node.js and Express.js, which handle the HTTP requests and routing.
   - When the user submits the form, a POST request is sent to the server with the starting location and destination.
   - The server-side code receives the request and passes the input to a Python script.

3. **Python Script:**
   - The Python script uses Selenium to automate browser actions and interact with the Google Maps web page.
   - The script navigates to the Google Maps website and enters the starting location and destination.
   - It retrieves the directions and extracts the relevant information using Beautiful Soup.
   - The parsed directions are returned as a response to the server.

4. **Response Handling:**
   - The server receives the response from the Python script, which contains the directions.
   - The server sends the directions as a JSON response back to the frontend.
   - The frontend JavaScript code handles the response and displays the directions to the user on the web page.

#Installation and Setup
To run the Chatbot Directions application, follow these steps:

1. Install Node.js and Python on your machine.
2. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
3. Install the required Node.js dependencies by running `npm install` in the project directory.
4. Install the required Python dependencies by running `pip install -r requirements.txt` in the project directory.
5. Download the appropriate WebDriver (e.g., ChromeDriver) and set the path to the WebDriver executable in the Python script.
6. Start the Node.js server by running `node app.js` in the project directory.
7. Access the application in your web browser at `http://localhost:3000`.

# Future Enhancements
Here are some potential enhancements that can be made to the Chatbot Directions application:

1. **User Authentication:** Implement user authentication and session management to allow users to save their favorite locations and access them later.
2. **

Alternative Routing Services:** Integrate additional mapping and routing services to provide users with alternative routes and compare them.
3. **Real-Time Traffic Information:** Fetch real-time traffic data and consider it while providing directions to users for more accurate estimates.
4. **Speech Recognition:** Implement speech recognition capabilities to allow users to input locations by speaking instead of typing.
5. **Mobile Application:** Develop a mobile application version of the chatbot to provide directions on the go.

This documentation provides an overview of the Chatbot Directions application, the technologies used, its functionality, and suggestions for future enhancements. It should help you understand the application better and guide you in maintaining and expanding its features.
